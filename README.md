# Custom Minecraft Mob Tutorial
A bare bones Minecraft Forge Mod to demonstrate custom mob / custom entity functionality.

Updated and boiled down version of https://github.com/techgeek1019/ModdingTutorial that works with Forge 1.8 for an easy first tutorial in Minecraft Forge Modding.

Many thanks to @techgeek1019 for the amazing original Forge 1.7 tutorial. Other resources that might be helpful: https://github.com/ustc-zzzz/fmltutor/wiki/3.1.2-%E6%96%B0%E7%9A%84%E7%94%9F%E7%89%A9%E6%B8%B2%E6%9F%93%E6%A8%A1%E5%9E%8B (Great tutorial in Chinese).
